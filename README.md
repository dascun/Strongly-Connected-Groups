# Strongly-Connected-Groups
Here is a solution provided to the strongly connected groups problem using python and networkx.

# Problem Description
**Strong relation group:** Each vertices is connected to every other node in the sub-graph.

Given number of **vertices**, and number of **edges**, find the minimum size of the largest *"strong relation group"* in a graph.

For example, if there are **3 vertices** and **2 edges** in a graph, minimum size would be **2** since two of the three nodes would be connected to the same third node, but not to each other. Likewise, when there are **5 vertices** and **7 edges**, only **3** of them would be connected with each other, forming a sub-graph which is a strong relation group.
